# MDM-Portal-
This repo is where we'll do project management for the MDM portal project.

Project Goal: Create a centralized site that allows staff and contributors to discover and access Mozillian individuals, communities and effectively connect to high-impact contribution opportunities. 

This is part of the mission-driven mozillians project work for 2019 that you can read about on discourse [here](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/mission-driven-mozillians-2019-update/35430).
